- choose the save location and output filename when starting the program
    - one button for both 'save as' and 'start' 'save as\n &\n start\n'
- when the user presses escape
    - file is saved``````
    - delete file name


- option not to save?
- print a message to the gui that shows the user the save location and time

Things to consider:
- Make a GUI using PyQt5
- Option not to save Scripts (using checkbox
- recognizing shift before a key, and then processing it as hotkey(['shift'],'a')
